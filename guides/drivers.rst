Official Drivers
=======

How does Mink provide a consistent API for very different browser library
types, often written in different languages? Through drivers! A Mink driver
is a simple class, that implements ``Behat\Mink\Driver\DriverInterface``.
This interface describes bridge methods between Mink and real browser emulators.
Mink always talks with browser emulators through its driver. It doesn't know
anything about how to start/stop or traverse page in that particular browser
emulator. It only knows what driver method it should call in order to do this.

Mink comes with six drivers out of the box:

    /drivers/goutte
    /drivers/browserkit
    /drivers/selenium2
    /drivers/zombie
    /drivers/sahi
    /drivers/selenium

Driver Feature Support
----------------------

Although Mink does its best on removing browser differences between different
browser emulators, it can't do much in some cases. For example, BrowserKitDriver
cannot evaluate JavaScript and Selenium2Driver cannot get the response status
code. In such cases, the driver will always throw a meaningful
``Behat\Mink\Exception\UnsupportedDriverActionException``.
